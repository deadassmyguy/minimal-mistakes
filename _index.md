Last updated:01/08/2025

Happy New Year, everyone. I hope everyone enjoys time with their friends and family. I spent some time [reflecting on 2024](/categories/mastery/reflecting-on-2024) and I'm excited for 2025.

## Professional

A few _professional_ updates:

- I was affected by the layoffs at Messari. It was a great run, I am happy about my time there. But I am equally happy to be moving on.

- Crypto is having a moment in the mainstream, and I'm very happy about it. It's been tough in the trenches over the last few years. If you're looking to learn more, check out my [starter guide](categories/cryptocurrency_and_the_blockchain/crypto-starter-guide). It's a bit dated but has some interesting resources.

## Personal

A few personal updates:

- College wrestling just started, and I am really excited for another season.

- I finished God of War (2018) and have graduated to God of War Ragnorok. I am loving the new God of War installation and learning about Norse mythology.

- I am finally good at Snowboarding. My wife and I took a trip to the Catskills and I was able to shred. I am excited to hit the slopes on my annual guys trip during MLK weekend.

- My wife and I are headed to Puerto Rico in February. If you have any recommendations, please let me know.
