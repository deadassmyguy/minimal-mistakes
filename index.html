<p>Happy New Year, everyone. I hope everyone enjoys time with their friends and family. I spent some time <a href="/categories/mastery/reflecting-on-2024">reflecting on 2024</a> and I’m excited for 2025.</p>

<p>A few <em>professional</em> updates:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I was affected by the layoffs at Messari. It was a great run, I am happy about my time there. But I am equally happy to be moving on.</p></li>
<li><p>Crypto is having a moment in the mainstream, and I’m very happy about it. It’s been tough in the trenches over the last few years. If you’re looking to learn more, check out my <a href="categories/cryptocurrency_and_the_blockchain/crypto-starter-guide">starter guide</a>. It’s a bit dated but has some interesting resources.</p></li>

<p>A few personal updates:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>College wrestling just started, and I am really excited for another season.</p></li>
<li><p>I finished God of War (2018) and have graduated to God of War Ragnorok. I am loving the new God of War installation and learning about Norse mythology.</p></li>
<li><p>I am finally good at Snowboarding. My wife and I took a trip to the Catskills and I was able to shred. I am excited to hit the slopes on my annual guys trip during MLK weekend.</p></li>
